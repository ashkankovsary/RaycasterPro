                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Raycasting is a method used to transform a 2D game environment into a 3D space.
                        This technique casts a ray for each pixel along the width of the screen.

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        By calculating the distance from the player to the wall using the DDA algorithm,
                        the length of the ray is determined. This length is then used to calculate the height of the
                        wall.
                        Naturally, the further the player is from the wall, the shorter the height of that wall's pixel
                        will be.
                        This creates the illusion of three-dimensionality for the player.

                    <h3>Challenge 1: Installing the Raylib Library</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first challenge was spending a lot of time installing the Raylib library, which was quite
                        frustrating.
                        My mistake was not starting the project with Linux from the beginning.

                    <h3>Challenge 2: Understanding the DDA Algorithm</h3>
                    <p>
                        My second challenge was the DDA algorithm. While I was able to find the code with the help of a
                        chatbot,
                        it took a considerable amount of time to understand how it works and its internal logic.
